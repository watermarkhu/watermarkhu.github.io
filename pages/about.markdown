Hi, my name is Mark. I am attentive to detail and well organized and always aim to fulfill a target without compromises. I am always eager to learn, use, and produce innovative tools to tackle complex problems that are both tangible and easy to use, and I love to share that knowledge with others.

In my free time, I enjoy playing games online, working out, and working towards the feeling after a run (not the run itself, per se). I spend more time making automations (and updating them after breaking changes) for my smart home than the time that is saved by these automations. And what time that remains is spend on browsing for new shows to watch but always ends with another rewatch of The Last Airbender.

<!-- I was born in Xi An (西安), China, and moved to Shenzhen (深圳) for elementary school. At the age of 9, I migrated with my parents to Eindhoven, The Netherlands. At the International School, I was tought Dutch rapidly and I was well integrated within a year.  -->
